# LibTabularasa

## Introduction

Small C++ library which allows to generate printable tables like this:

```
+-------+---------+---+
|  Foo  |     Bar | - |
+-------+---------+---+
| 12345 |       X | y |
|  123  | 12345-r | n |
| 2345  |       Y | n |
+-------+---------+---+
```

See unittest/TableTest.cpp for usage reference.

## Features

* Generates ASCII art tables with dynamic or fixed width columns
* Stream output (i.e. cout, stringstream, fstream etc.)
* Horizontal alignment based on column settings with the ability to override the alignment per cell
* Compact output supported by omitting the upper and lower border and spaces within table cells
* Color support using ANSI code sequences supported by the vast majority of terminals (foreground and background coloring)
* No external dependencies other than C++ standard library

## Debian/Ubuntu package

To build the Debian/Ubuntu package from these sources please clone the repository and run

```
dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us -b
```

Then install the packages using

```
sudo dpkg -i ../libtabularasa*.deb
```

Make sure you have debhelper installed (```apt install debhelper```).

## Usage

The package provides a pkg-config file which allows to integrate the library using autotools and/or cmake.

Have a look into unittest/TableTest.cpp on how to use the library.

## Unittests

The unittests are using GTest (Google Test Framework) shipped with this repository (see external/gtest/LICENSE for details).

To compile and execute the unittest do the following

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DWITH_UNITTESTS=True .. && make gtest && ./gtest
```

A coverage report can be generated by using i.e. gcovr as follows:

```
gcovr build -r tabularasa -s --html -o contrib/coverage.html
```
